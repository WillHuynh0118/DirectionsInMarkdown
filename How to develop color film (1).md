##### **ATTENTION: This guide is for specifically for the popular Cinestill CS41 2-bath kit**
 Knowing how to develop color film is an important skill every photographer still utilizing this bygone medium should have. 

## Materials needed
- Film development tank with tank reels
- Thermometer
- Dark bag / dark room
- Scissors
- Cinestill CS41 "Color Simplified" 2-Bath kit
-- Developer
-- Blix
- film (Either 35mm or 120mm)
- Small water bath
- Water temperature regulator (Sous Vide machine)
- Powder free nitrile gloves
- 2 chemical bottles

## Steps
 ### Setting up your tank
1. Fill the small water bath with water.
2. Heat the bath to 102&deg;F with the water temperature regulator.
 -- **The temperature of the water has to be exactly 102&deg;F or the film will not develop properly.**
### Preparing chemicals
###### **ATTENTION: BEFORE PREPARING THE CHEMICALS PLEASE WEAR THE POWDER FREE NITRILE**
3. In one chemical bottle, mix your blix powder with water and put it in your water bath.
4. In the other bottle, repeat this process with your developer powder.
5. Set the both bottles of developer and blix into the water bath to heat up to 102&deg;F.
 ### Preparing your development tank
6. In complete darkness (either using a dark room or the dark bag), open your roll of film.
-- **If the film has a leader (Curved part of the film), use scissors to trim it off so it is easier to load onto the development reel.**
7. While in complete darkness, slot the film into the development reels and wind the film up onto the reel until none of it is dangling around.
-- **If the film is exposed to any light, photos on the film will be lost.**
8. While in complete darkness, put the reel with the film contained in it into the developemnt tank and close the lid.
### Development
###### **ATTENTION: BEFORE FOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS, MAKE SURE THE BLIX AND DEVELOPER SOLUTION ARE AT 102&deg;F USING A THEMOMETER.**
9. Soak the film in the 102&deg;F water for one minute. After the 1 minute, pour the water back into the water bath.
10. Set a timer for 3.5 minutes and start it when you pour in your developer solution.
11. > Put on the cap of the development tank.
12. >for the first 10 seconds, spin your tank forwards and backwards and then sideways.
13. > After the 10 seconds, do the exact same motion 4 times every 30 seconds until the timer runs out.
14. > Pour out your solution into its respective bottle.
-- **The blix and developer can be reused to develop up to 24 rolls of film if kept stored in a dry cool place.**
15. Set a timer for 8 minutes and start it when you pour in your blix solution.
16. Repeat steps 11 - 14 for the blix solution.
17. After the blix solution has been rebottled, fill up and then empty the tank with the 102&deg;F water 7 times.
-- **This is to clean the film of the blix solution.**
18. Put the film tank under room temperature running water for 1 minute.
-- **This is to stop the film from developing any further.**
## Congratulations! You just developed some film!
##### Now just crack open tha development tank and hang up your negatives to dry!
